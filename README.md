  The purview of discourseâ€”unending; I've engineered this site to exhibit roughly organized thoughts for any fascination, guide, or conflict I have worth mentioning. At least thats its purpose at the time I write this (Epoch: 1721839525). When Karnovah is realized, the concerns will extrapolate to project updates for audiences interested and involved.
