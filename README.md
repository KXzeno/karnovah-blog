  The purview of discourse—unending; I've engineered this site to exhibit roughly organized thoughts for any fascination, guide, or conflict I have worth mentioning. At least thats its purpose at the time I write this (Epoch: 1721839525). When Karnovah is realized, the concerns will extrapolate to project updates for audiences interested and involved.

#### Background

During freshman year of college, I wanted to create a [blog site](https://github.com/KXzeno/WorKx) without needing to learn much and thus was recommended [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a markdown-based static site generator. The setup, maintenance, and *limited* feature creation being very intuitive allowed building sites within days. After a while scrutinizing the details I cannot change, I've later committed experimenting with tech for more control, like using Express, JavaScript, and HTML.

Come to now, I've built my own blogsite from the ground up with the tools below. This is officially my first complex and somewhat stable full-stack app to ship to production. If you're an experienced developer, you will find peculiar approaches, non-conventions, and scattered documentation, so for better technical assessments, veer toward my other projects, otherwise, welcome to the vestiges of my growth's nascency.
